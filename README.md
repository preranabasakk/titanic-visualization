## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **File used:** `titanic.csv` (originally `train.csv` from Kaggle)

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess missing data
- Visualize key features like:
  - Survival rate
  - Gender distribution
  - Passenger class impact
  - Age distribution
  - Correlation heatmap

---

## 📊 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- 📦 Count plots for survival analysis
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender vs Survival
- 🎓 Class vs Survival
- 🎂 Age distribution histogram
- 🔥 Correlation heatmap

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare amount and class showed correlation with survival.
